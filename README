This is an API server for a large database of movie ratings. The database includes
three tables: Movies, Raters, Ratings.

The database was established with data migrations. The API is built using the
Django REST framework.

The ratings contain two foreign keys, displayed as hyperlinks. The ratings also
include an added field showing the movie_title as a convenient reference field.
